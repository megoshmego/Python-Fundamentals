- [Instructor] Before we go any further,
0:05
we need to talk about indentation,
0:07
a really important distinction between Python
0:10
and many other languages, including JavaScript.
0:14
So we often use curly braces
0:16
in some programming languages to denote code blocks,
0:19
like we do in JavaScript.
0:21
In order to make it clear that these two lines belong inside
0:25
of this conditional, we use those curly braces.
0:28
And we typically indent to make things nicer
0:31
and easier to understand.
0:34
But it's just about readability.
0:35
It doesn't impact the functionality
0:37
of the code or the behavior.
0:40
So we could also write it this way, in JavaScript at least.
0:43
We have the two curly braces.
0:45
That's all that matters.
0:46
The indentation is there just so that we don't go crazy.
0:49
So we definitely don't recommend
0:51
you write your code this way.
0:53
Python is different.
0:54
In Python, we don't use those curly braces for blocks.
0:58
All that matters is the indentation.
1:01
And this is a pretty significant difference from JavaScript.
1:04
In this code here, these indentations are what tell Python
1:09
these two lines belong as part of this conditional.
1:13
They will only run if age is greater than or equal to 18.
1:16
And by the way, we haven't talked about conditionals yet,
1:19
but I'm just starting with indentation.
1:21
Then we'll come back and talk about conditionals.
1:23
This is very different than the code down here.
1:26
In this case, we have our conditional,
1:29
and this one print line, this print function call will run
1:32
if age is greater than or equal to 18.
1:35
And register to vote always runs,
1:38
very slight difference
1:40
in terms of the actual syntax we type,
1:43
but a very major difference when we actually run this code.
1:47
So indentation is crucial in Python.
1:49
That is, as I've said already,
1:51
one of the most important differences,
1:53
one of the things that will take you maybe the longest
1:55
to get used to.
1:57
But because in JavaScript we should already be indenting
2:00
our code in ways that hopefully makes it more readable,
2:04
it shouldn't be that major of a shift.
2:07
Typically in JavaScript,
2:09
we use two or four spaces for indentation.
2:12
In Python, everyone agrees
2:15
it should always be four spaces.
2:17
However, Python doesn't actually care.
2:19
You could indent everything with two spaces.
2:22
You just wanna be consistent,
2:23
but most editors are going to default to four.
2:26
IPython will default to four spaces.
2:29
So that's what you want to be using.
2:31
But let me just show you how this works.
2:33
So I have IPython open over here.
2:35
We haven't talked about conditionals,
2:37
but I'm gonna go ahead and show you something very quickly.
2:40
Let's make a variable called age.
2:42
We'll set it to 17.
2:44
In IPython, if I type,
2:47
you probably already saw that.
2:48
I'm defaulting to JavaScript already with those parentheses.
2:51
We don't need that in Python.
2:53
If I do something like if age is less than 18,
2:58
if I hit Enter, IPython automatically indents me
3:02
because it assumes that I want to write some code
3:05
that is part of this conditional block.
3:08
So I'll write something like, print "you are a child."
3:14
And in order to get out of this, if we go to the last line
3:18
in IPython and I hit Enter, it will run.
3:21
You are a child.
3:23
If I write another line down here print
3:26
"come back when you are 18 or older"
3:35
like that,
3:36
and I hit Enter,
3:38
both of those lines run because age is 17.
3:41
If I hit the up arrow and I instead change this,
3:45
oops, not like that.
3:47
If I instead do this here,
3:49
and I changed the value of age, so let me quickly do that.
3:55
Let's set age now to be 20,
3:59
And I recall this code, age is now not less than 18,
4:03
so this code will not run, but this will always run.
4:06
It's not associated in any way with this conditional.
4:10
And so we always get
4:11
"come back when you are 18 or older"
4:12
even though age is 20.
4:15
Another important thing here
4:16
is that you'll actually get an error
4:19
if you don't have some indentation here.
4:21
If I just hit Enter,
4:23
it tells me "expected an indented block"
4:26
but it didn't get one.
4:27
What's going on,
4:28
well, we have a conditional.
4:30
In Python, think of it in JavaScript,
4:33
if you had a conditional statement
4:35
with no code associated with it,
4:37
you just had if age less than 18 and then nothing else,
4:41
it's an error.
4:43
Also, just to show you this,
4:45
if you had two spaces, it's still going to work.
4:51
It works fine.
4:51
We don't get anything because age is not less than 18.
4:56
If we had three spaces, it works fine.
4:58
But the default, the standard, whenever I start typing,
5:02
at least in IPython and in VS Code and I format the code.
5:06
Let's do if age,
5:07
how about just if three equals three.
5:13
Automatically it indents me four spaces.
5:15
We can count them.
5:17
There we go.
5:18
What we have is four,
5:19
one, two, three, four,
5:21
and then we can write some code in here.
5:22
Whatever it is, we'll just print true.
5:28
And there we go.
5:30
So the indentation matters.
5:31
You will see this all the time.
5:33
So not just with conditionals,
5:35
but also functions and classes and loops.
5:38
This is something that we'll see over and over and over.
5:41
And just as a quick demonstration in VS Code,
5:44
if I start typing something, let's do,
5:47
I'm in a Python file by the way, test.py.
5:50
We'll talk about running code from a file,
5:52
but if we set something like color equals purple.
5:56
And then I have my conditional.
5:58
If color equals, I don't know,
6:02
green and I hit Enter
6:05
and I type some code, print green, and I save,
6:10
it automatically formats me to four spaces.
6:14
One, two, three, four.
6:16
Okay, so we haven't talked
6:17
about running code or executing a file yet.
6:20
We'll stick to IPython for a little longer,
6:22
but just remember indentation matters.
6:24
That is a significant change from JavaScript.
6:27
It makes your code nice and easy to read,
6:30
but it can be a bit of a headache when you're switching
6:33
between JavaScript and Python.
6:34
And you're maybe getting lazy
6:37
about indentation in JavaScript.
6:39
That's not going to fly in Python,
6:40
so you have to be careful.
6:41
But as long as you follow the rules,
6:43
it makes your code nice and clean and easy to read.
6:46
Okay.
