Video Title: For Loops
Section Title: Python Fundamentals
Subsection Title: Python Introduction

Key Terms/Ideas/Concepts:
- For Loops: a type of loop used in Python to iterate over an iterable object
- Iterable: an object capable of returning its elements one at a time (e.g., strings, lists)
- Range: a built-in function in Python used to generate a sequence of numbers
- Three-part loop: a type of loop used in JavaScript that has three components: a variable declaration, a condition, and an increment/decrement
- For of loop: a type of loop used in JavaScript to iterate over an iterable object
- For in loop: a type of loop used in Python and JavaScript to iterate over an iterable object
- Trade-off: a situation where one thing must be given up to gain another thing
- While loop: a type of loop used in Python and JavaScript that runs as long as the specified condition is true

Certainly! Here's an example code to demonstrate for loops in Python:

```python
# Iterate over a list of colors
colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green"]
for color in colors:
    print(color)

# Iterate over a string
string = "Hello, world!"
for char in string:
    print(char)

# Generate a sequence of numbers using range
for num in range(10):
    print(num)

# Iterate over a range with a specified start and stop
for num in range(2, 10):
    print(num)

# Iterate over a range with a specified step
for num in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(num)
```

You can copy and paste this code into a Python file and run it to see the output. The code demonstrates iterating over a list, a string, and using the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers with different start, stop, and step values.
