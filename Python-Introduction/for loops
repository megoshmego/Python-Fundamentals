- [Instructor] Okay, so we've covered while loops in Python.
0:07
Next, let's talk about for loops.
0:09
Now in JavaScript,
0:10
for loops are these three part loops, right?
0:13
Where we have some variable,
0:15
like for let i equals 10.
0:19
And then we have our second portion of the loop,
0:22
so our variable declaration,
0:24
then we have the conditioned i less than 50,
0:28
and then we have some sort of updating
0:30
or in this case, an incrementing of i,
0:34
and then our curly braces and so on.
0:36
In Python, there is no equivalent for loop.
0:39
There is a for loop the keyword for,
0:42
but it does not work this way.
0:45
Instead, we have a for loop that works
0:47
or behaves much like the for of loop in JavaScript.
0:51
So where we have some sort of iterable,
0:54
and we iterate through that iterable.
0:56
So hopping over to JavaScript for a moment
0:59
where we have something like for let X,
1:06
or how about character of hello?
1:12
This is JavaScript, we'll console.log character.
1:19
And there we go, H-E-L-L-O.
1:21
So this for of loop is going to iterate over a string,
1:25
and array, some sort of iterable, a set in Python.
1:29
It's not a for of loop.
1:30
Technically, the syntax is for,
1:34
and then something in.
1:37
So in JavaScript for in will iterate
1:39
over an object in Python,
1:41
a for in, we usually just call it a for loop
1:44
because it's the only type of for loop.
1:46
It's going to iterate over an iterable
1:48
like a list, or a string, or a set.
1:52
So here's an example.
1:53
We have a list that has three items,
1:55
before I snack in this list,
1:57
we're going to print i ate a, and then the snack.
2:02
So one more time,
2:03
there is no equivalent to that
2:05
three part for loop that we have in JavaScript.
2:07
The standard form usually i, or j, or k loop,
2:11
we do not have that in Python.
2:13
Instead, let's have some lists.
2:16
Let's go with colors, I know it's boring.
2:20
Red, orange, yellow, and stop at green.
2:26
Okay, for color, in colors.
2:32
We'll, print color to start.
2:36
Let's run it, I'll clear, I'll Python,
2:39
run that same file,
2:41
red, orange, yellow, green,
2:43
they all get printed out.
2:45
We also could do something like this
2:47
for a character in some string like
2:51
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, N, O, P,
2:56
Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z.
3:01
Oh geez, I bit off a bit more than I can chew there.
3:05
We will print that character.
3:09
Let's run it, and there we go.
3:12
We're printing each character in that string.
3:14
So strings are iterables, lists are iterables.
3:17
There are other iterables
3:18
but we haven't talked about them yet.
3:20
So this means if you wanna loop five times,
3:23
it's all you care about,
3:24
you could use a while loop,
3:25
or you could do something like this
3:27
which is kind of annoying to make a list of five items,
3:31
or if you wanted to just repeat something exactly five times
3:35
like I wanna print, hello five times,
3:38
I could do this,
3:39
for, let's go with num, in,
3:43
and then some five item string,
3:46
or five item long list, like A, B, C, D, E.
3:51
This will repeat five times.
3:53
Now that seems like a lot of extra stuff that we don't need,
3:57
and it seems like there should be an easier way
3:59
just to repeat something five times,
4:01
and there is, but we haven't talked about it yet.
4:04
So at its core, the for loop in Python
4:08
is going to iterate over some iterable,
4:10
a string, or a list really are the two we've seen so far.
4:13
And we don't have that traditional
4:15
three part four loop that we have in JavaScript.
4:18
However, we do have something we don't have in JavaScript.
4:22
In Python, we can use something called a range.
4:25
Now, a range is a really nice way of generating numbers.
4:29
In the next video,
4:30
I'm gonna go into more detail about how they work.
4:32
There's more to it than what I'm showing you right here,
4:34
but this is a simple way to iterate
4:37
not only just five times,
4:38
but to iterate over the numbers between zero and five,
4:42
not including five.
4:44
So I'll just demonstrate this,
4:45
for numb or n in range of 10.
4:51
If we print n, you'll see what we get here,
4:57
we get zero, one, two, three, four,
4:59
five, six, seven, eight, nine.
5:01
Now in JavaScript to do this,
5:02
we would have to do for let i or n equal zero.
5:07
i less than 10, i plus plus
5:11
console.log n.
5:13
This is much, much simpler.
5:15
So it's a trade-off a lot of the time
5:18
when we're using a standard for loop
5:19
like this in JavaScript,
5:21
for just using numbers,
5:23
we're trynna generate numbers anyway.
5:25
Especially now that we have for of in JavaScript,
5:28
most of the time we don't actually write this that often,
5:30
but if we do, we're usually working with numbers,
5:33
we wanna generate integers.
5:35
So it's not a big loss in Python
5:36
that we don't have this three part loop
5:38
because we have ranges.
5:40
And we'll see how ranges work
5:42
in more detail in the next video.
5:44
But for now, we have a for loop
5:46
which is closer to a for of in JavaScript,
5:49
even though we use the in keyword
5:52
for something in this iterable.
5:54
For numb in that string,
5:56
for color in that colors list.
5:59
And then we also have ranges
6:00
which we'll expand upon in just a moment.
6:03
Okay, so that's a basic intro to Python for loops.
