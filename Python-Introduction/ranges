Would you please evaluate the transcript I provide for its key terms, ideas, concepts and their defintions. Would you also please include the video title “Ranges”, the subsection title "Python Introduction", and the section title "Python Fundamentals"?

- Next step I'd like to focus more on ranges.
0:07
So we saw that we have an easy way of iterating five times
0:11
from zero to four in this case, using this range here
0:15
but there's more two ranges.
0:17
It's one of my favorite features in Python
0:19
and I wish JavaScript supported this.
0:21
It's a really easy way of generating ranges of numbers.
0:25
So on the documentation under ranges
0:28
we can see that one option is simply to pass
0:31
in a stopping point, which is what we did here.
0:34
Range five wIll stop right before five,
0:37
or it stops at five, not including five.
0:40
So it generates the integers
0:42
and the default start point is zero,
0:44
but we can also pass in a start and a stop
0:48
as well as a step or an interval.
0:51
So I'll show you how that works.
0:53
First of all, the easiest way to see
0:54
what's going on with the range
0:56
if we do like range of nine for example,
0:59
we're not actually going to see the numbers
1:01
and this is a really interesting part of how ranges work
1:04
if you go back to the documentation
1:06
and scroll down somewhere, here we go.
1:08
Where are you?
1:09
The advantage of the range, blah, blah blah
1:12
is that a range object will always take
1:13
the same small amount of memory,
1:16
no matter the size of the range it represents
1:18
it only stores the start stop and step values
1:22
and it calculates the individual items as needed.
1:25
So making a range on its own
1:27
is not actually going to create all of those numbers for us
1:30
from zero through nine.
1:31
It's only going to store the start the stop and the step,
1:35
which defaults to one
1:37
zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
1:39
but if we want to expose those numbers
1:41
if we wanna use the numbers
1:43
that are represented by this range,
1:45
we could loop
1:46
we could do four num in range
1:50
of nine
1:52
print num
1:54
like that,
1:55
or just for demonstration purposes
1:57
we can turn that range into a list.
1:59
So range of nine, let's do 10 this time,
2:03
make me a list with that range
2:05
and it will iterate over the values in that range
2:08
and then put them all in a new list for us.
2:10
So that's an easy way of making an array
2:12
and oh I keep saying array a list
2:15
in this case that contains the numbers from zero to nine.
2:18
But as I mentioned there's more
2:20
to just declaring a stopping point
2:22
we can also add in a starting point
2:24
so we can go from five to 10, not including 10.
2:27
So five is included
2:29
six, seven, eight, nine, and then we stop.
2:32
We can do negative numbers, negative 100 to zero
2:38
if we wanna do and you end up
2:40
with a very long list,
2:42
negative 100 all the way up to negative one,
2:45
we also can specify a step
2:48
so we could go from one to 10
2:52
with a step of two,
2:54
which gives us one, three, five, seven, nine.
2:57
If I wanted the even numbers starting at two,
3:00
and I want to stop at 10,
3:02
but I want to include 10 I could do
3:05
this right here
3:07
now I have two, four, six, eight
3:09
so moved by twos
3:10
the step or the interval is two
3:12
begin and include the number two
3:15
and then stop and don't include 12
3:18
which means we stop at 10.
3:20
So we can iterate over them
3:22
as we saw earlier, like we have here
3:24
for n in range,
3:26
but we can also create lists with them
3:28
there's actually another way to create lists
3:30
we'll see later on.
3:31
But the point is that these ranges
3:32
are really useful in my opinion,
3:34
we can also go backwards if you wanted to,
3:37
it doesn't work to do this
3:39
if we had range of say 10 to zero,
3:43
because the default step is going to be one
3:46
and we're starting at 10, we're supposed to go to zero
3:49
but we add one, well, that's going the wrong direction
3:51
so the range is done.
3:54
However, if we add in that step of negative one
3:57
now we can go from 10 down to zero
4:00
which is actually going to stop at one.
4:02
We could go down by fours if we wanted to.
4:06
And that's pretty much it to ranges.
4:07
You can pass in only a stopping point like 10
4:11
and by default it will start at zero
4:13
and then the interval will be one.
4:15
We can also pass in a specific start and a stop
4:20
and we can specify the interval or the step.
4:24
So ranges are really useful in my opinion
4:26
if you needed to generate all the even numbers
4:28
from one to 50, if you needed to generate
4:31
I don't know, steps by five, from 50 to 100
4:35
those are kind of odd examples
4:36
but there are times when you want a range of numbers
4:39
and you can use range to help you out.
4:41
It's a nice feature in Python.
