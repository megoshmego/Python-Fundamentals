Definitions:
- Functions: A set of instructions that can be called and executed multiple times throughout a program.
- Syntax: A set of rules that define how code should be written in a programming language.
- Parameters: Inputs that are defined when a function is declared and can be passed in when the function is called.
- Return: The value or values that a function outputs after being executed.
- None: A built-in Python object that represents the absence of a value or null value.
- Type Checking: A process of verifying the data type of a value or object.
- Indentation: The use of whitespace at the beginning of a line of code to denote its level of hierarchy or association with a particular block of code.
- Arguments: Values that are passed into a function when it is called.
- Type Function: A built-in Python function that returns the type of a given value or object.
- Integers: Whole numbers in Python without any decimal places.
- Floats: Decimal numbers in Python.
- Conditional Statements: Statements that execute different code depending on whether a certain condition is true or false.
- Function Body: The block of code within a function that is executed when the function is called.



Sure! Here's an example code that demonstrates Python functions and their usage:

```python
# Define a function that greets a person
def greet(person):
    return f"Hello there, {person}!"

# Call the greet function
print(greet("Thomas"))  # Output: Hello there, Thomas!

# Define a function that divides two integers
def divide(a, b):
    if isinstance(a, int) and isinstance(b, int):
        return a / b
    else:
        return "a and b must be integers."

# Call the divide function
print(divide(1, 2))  # Output: 0.5
print(divide(2, 1))  # Output: 2.0
print(divide(1, "2"))  # Output: a and b must be integers.
```

In this code, we define two functions: `greet()` and `divide()`. The `greet()` function takes a person's name as input and returns a greeting message, while the `divide()` function takes two integers as input and returns their quotient. 

We then call these functions with different arguments to demonstrate their usage. Note that the `isinstance()` function is used to check the type of the input arguments in the `divide()` function, and return an error message if they are not integers.
