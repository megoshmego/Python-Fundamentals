Title: Declaring Variables
Section: Python Fundamentals
Subsection: Python Introduction

Key terms/ideas:
- Variable: A value that is being stored with a label or a name.
- Label: A name or identifier given to a variable to help refer to it.
- Lower-snake case: The naming style convention in Python, where variable names use all lowercase letters and individual words are separated by underscores.
- Declaration: The process of creating or defining a variable.
- Syntax: The rules and structure of a language or programming code.
- Keyword: A reserved word in a programming language that has a special meaning and purpose.
- Initialization: The act of giving a variable its first value.
- Constant: A value that cannot be changed after it has been assigned.
- Scope: The part of the program where a variable is visible and can be accessed.
- Function: A block of code that performs a specific task and can be called or executed when needed.
- Block scoping: The scope of a variable is limited to the block where it is declared.
- Numbers: A data type in Python that represents numerical values.
- Strings: A data type in Python that represents a sequence of characters.
- Booleans: A data type in Python that represents True or False values.
- Arrays: A data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type.
- Objects: A data structure that stores a collection of properties or attributes.

Definitions:
- Variable: A value that is being stored with a label or a name. In Python, a variable is created by simply writing the name of the variable, followed by an equal sign and the value that it should store.
- Label: A name or identifier given to a variable to help refer to it.
- Lower-snake case: The naming style convention in Python, where variable names use all lowercase letters and individual words are separated by underscores. For example, `num_students` or `first_name`.
- Declaration: The process of creating or defining a variable.
- Syntax: The rules and structure of a language or programming code.
- Keyword: A reserved word in a programming language that has a special meaning and purpose. In Python, there is no keyword to declare a variable, unlike in other languages like JavaScript, which uses keywords such as `let`, `var`, or `const`.
- Initialization: The act of giving a variable its first value. In Python, a variable is initialized by assigning a value to it using the equal sign (`=`).
- Constant: A value that cannot be changed after it has been assigned. In Python, there is no specific way to make a constant, but conventionally, constants are written in all uppercase letters to indicate that they should not be changed.
- Scope: The part of the program where a variable is visible and can be accessed. In Python, variables are scoped to functions, meaning that they are only accessible within the function where they are declared.
- Function: A block of code that performs a specific task and can be called or executed when needed. In Python, a function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the name of the function and its parameters.
- Block scoping: The scope of a variable is limited to the block where it is declared. In Python, block scoping can be achieved using keywords like `if`, `while`, or `for`.
- Numbers: A data type in Python that represents numerical values, including integers, floats, and complex numbers.
- Strings: A data type in Python that represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
- Booleans: A data type in Python that represents True or False values.
- Arrays: A data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type. In Python, arrays are represented using lists.

Sure! Here are some examples of variable declarations in Python:

```python
# declaring a variable with an integer value
num_students = 30

# declaring a variable with a float value
pi = 3.14

# declaring a variable with a boolean value
is_sunny = True

# declaring a variable with a string value
name = "Alice"

# declaring a variable with a list value
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# declaring a variable with a dictionary value
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
```

Note that in Python, we don't need to specify the data type of the variable explicitly, as Python is dynamically typed. Also, variable names in Python should be written in lowercase with underscores separating words, although this is not enforced by the language itself.
