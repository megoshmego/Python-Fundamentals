The key terms, ideas, and concepts in this transcript are:

- Function arguments: values passed to a function when calling it.
- Python Introduction: the section of the tutorial/course that covers basic concepts of the Python programming language.
- Python Fundamentals: the overarching section of the tutorial/course that covers the fundamental concepts of the Python programming language.
- JavaScript function arguments: how function arguments work in the JavaScript programming language.
- Python function arguments: how function arguments work in the Python programming language.
- Omit: to leave out or exclude something.
- Undefined: a value in JavaScript that means a variable has been declared but has no assigned value.
- Problematic: something that causes problems or difficulties.
- Divide function: a function that divides two numbers.
- Required positional argument: an argument that must be provided when calling a function in its correct position.
- Type error: an error that occurs when an operation or function is applied to the wrong data type.
- Additional arguments: arguments that are not required by the function but can be provided.
- Keyword arguments: a way of passing arguments to a function using the name of the parameter.
- Named arguments: an alternative term for keyword arguments.
- Default values: values that a function argument will take if no value is provided when calling the function.
- Syntax: the rules that govern how words and symbols can be combined to form a sentence or expression in a programming language.
- Signature of a function: the list of arguments that a function accepts, along with their names and data types.
- Help: a built-in function in Python that provides information about a module, function, class, or method.
- Multiline string: a string that spans multiple lines of code.
- F-string: a string that allows for the inclusion of expressions within string literals by prefixing the string with the letter "f".
- Operator: a symbol or keyword that performs a specific mathematical or logical operation.
- Non-default argument: an argument that does not have a default value and must be provided when calling a function.
- Default argument: an argument that has a default value and can be omitted when calling a function.

Sure! Here's an example Python code for training a simple feedforward neural network using Keras with TensorFlow backend:

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# generate some sample data
x_train = np.random.random((1000, 10))
y_train = np.random.randint(2, size=(1000, 1))

# define the model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_dim=10))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# compile the model with binary crossentropy loss and adam optimizer
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',
              optimizer='adam',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=128)

# evaluate the model on test data
x_test = np.random.random((100, 10))
y_test = np.random.randint(2, size=(100, 1))
score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, batch_size=128)
print("Test loss:", score[0])
print("Test accuracy:", score[1])
```

In this code, we first generate some random training and test data using NumPy. Then we define the architecture of the neural network, which consists of an input layer, a hidden layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation, and an output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification. We compile the model with binary crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer, and then train the model using the `fit` method. Finally, we evaluate the model on test data using the `evaluate` method.

This is just a simple example, but it should give you an idea of how to train a feedforward neural network using Keras. Of course, there's a lot more to deep learning than this, but this is a good starting point for beginners. Good luck with your studies!
