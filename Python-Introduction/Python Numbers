Video title: Python Numbers
Section title: Python Fundamentals
Subsection title: Python Introduction

Key terms and concepts:
- Variables
- Number types: integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers
- Built-in method "type()"
- Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, double-slash division (integer division)
- Built-in functions for numbers: "abs()", "int()", "float()", "round()", "hex()", "is_integer()"
- Differences between Python and JavaScript number types and operations

Overall, the video provides an introduction to Python's number types and basic operations, highlighting the differences between Python and JavaScript. The video also briefly touches on built-in functions for numbers, including conversion methods and the "round()" function. The use of the "type()" method to verify number types is emphasized. The subsection title indicates that this is part of a larger section on Python Fundamentals, and the video title provides a specific focus on Python numbers.

Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's an example code for a simple neural network using the TensorFlow library in Python:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define the model architecture
model = keras.Sequential([
  layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
  layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Load the MNIST dataset
mnist = keras.datasets.mnist
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()

# Preprocess the data
train_images = train_images.reshape((60000, 784))
train_images = train_images / 255.0

test_images = test_images.reshape((10000, 784))
test_images = test_images / 255.0

train_labels = keras.utils.to_categorical(train_labels)
test_labels = keras.utils.to_categorical(test_labels)

# Train the model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model on the test set
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print('Test accuracy:', test_acc)
```

This code defines a simple neural network with two hidden layers, trains it on the MNIST dataset, and evaluates its accuracy on the test set. This is just a basic example to get you started, but there are many more advanced techniques and architectures that you can learn as you delve deeper into the field of deep learning. I hope this helps!
