Key terms/ideas/concepts:
- Server-side/back-end development: the part of web development responsible for the logic, authentication, and connecting to databases.
- Front-end/client-side development: the part of web development responsible for the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that users see and interact with on their browsers.
- Python: a high-level programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and vast range of applications.
- Node: a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side.
- HTML: a markup language used for creating websites.
- CSS: a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of HTML pages.
- JavaScript: a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic effects to web pages.
- Server logic: the part of back-end development responsible for handling data processing, calculations, and other complex operations on the server.
- Database: a structured set of data stored on a computer that can be accessed, managed, and updated by software applications.
- JSON: JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.
- Trending: a term used to describe the popularity of a topic or hashtag on social media, determined by a complex algorithm that takes into account the number of mentions, acceleration, spread, and other factors.
- Automated money management: a service that uses code and algorithms to invest money on behalf of clients.
- Security: measures taken to protect information, data, and resources from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

Note: This transcript contains a lot of information and examples related to back-end development, but it also touches on topics related to front-end development, databases, and social media. The key concepts mentioned above are the most relevant to the subsection title and section title.

Sure! Here's some sample code in Python that demonstrates how to implement a simple neural network using the Keras library:

```
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# create some dummy data for training
X_train = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]])
y_train = np.array([[0], [1], [1], [0]])

# define the model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(4, input_dim=2, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=1000, verbose=0)

# test the model
X_test = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]])
y_test = np.array([[0], [1], [1], [0]])

scores = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print("\n%s: %.2f%%" % (model.metrics_names[1], scores[1]*100))
```

This code creates a simple neural network with one hidden layer and trains it on a small dataset of XOR logic gate inputs and outputs. It then tests the model's accuracy on the same dataset.

To run this code, you'll need to have the Keras library installed on your system. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install keras
```

I hope this helps you get started with neural network programming!
