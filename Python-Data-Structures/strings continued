- [Instructor] Next up, we're going to talk
0:05
a bit more about strings.
0:07
We saw the basics of strings a couple videos ago.
0:10
But we're going to dive more into the methods
0:12
and some of the useful things
0:14
that we can do with strings.
0:16
First, let's quickly recap what we've seen before.
0:18
Strings are sequences of characters,
0:20
just like in JavaScript between quotation marks,
0:23
they are immutable.
0:25
Now we'll get back to that in a moment.
0:27
But as we've seen before,
0:28
we can use double quotes,
0:29
we can use single quotes.
0:31
And unlike JavaScript,
0:32
we can use triple quotes.
0:33
And this is most commonly used in two scenarios.
0:36
One is when you want a multiple line string,
0:39
and you want to be able to type it exactly
0:41
as it should look.
0:42
And then it will be turned into just a regular old string
0:45
with some new lines and tab characters
0:47
and whatever else thrown in.
0:49
But the second situation is when we create doc strings
0:52
for functions or classes,
0:53
as we learned a couple videos ago,
0:56
then we have F strings,
0:58
which allow us to create formatted strings,
1:00
they're just,
1:01
they're similar to string template literals in JavaScript,
1:04
so we prefix it with an F,
1:05
and then quotes,
1:07
and then whatever we have inside of that string,
1:09
we can interpolate expressions using curly braces.
1:14
So that's a really important thing we do all the time,
1:16
just go over this one more time,
1:18
we can make a price
1:20
and set that equal to I don't know, 350
1:23
and a quantity will be seven.
1:26
And then we could print an F string,
1:30
where we multiply price times quantity,
1:33
and we say your total is,
1:36
and we'll add dollar sign there,
1:37
this is different than JavaScript,
1:38
we don't need that dollar sign,
1:40
that's purely decorative.
1:42
We just need curly braces,
1:43
and we'll put price times quantity.
1:48
And we get your total is 24.5.
1:50
We put the dollar sign back there,
1:52
so that we end up with a price.
1:54
Okay, so that's F strings,
1:56
we can also do F strings on single quotes,
1:58
as well as triple quoted strings,
2:00
we can have multiple expressions in there.
2:03
That's pretty much it.
2:04
We also can turn things that are not strings into strings
2:07
by using the string STR constructor function.
2:10
So if I had a number of how about 5.6,
2:15
as a float,
2:16
turned it into a string,
2:17
it just puts quotes around it,
2:18
we can do this with a list.
2:20
So I could have three, four, or five,
2:22
and save that to a variable, call this nums.
2:26
If I do STR of nums,
2:28
we get three, four, or five as a string.
2:32
Next, we've seen that we can use in on a list.
2:36
So we could check if something was in nums,
2:39
like three in nums.
2:42
Nums is this list here,
2:43
it was not turned into a string
2:46
and saved to nums so we just turned it into a string
2:48
and then just released it into the world.
2:50
But nums is still a list.
2:52
So three and nums.
2:53
True, we can do the same thing with strings.
2:56
So I could have, I don't know,
2:58
a price string.
3:00
Price equals dollar sign 56 point 99.
3:04
And if I wanted to check if there was a dollar sign
3:07
in this string,
3:08
I could do dollar sign in price.
3:13
And that tells me yep,
3:14
there is dollar sign in there.
3:16
If I want to see if there is a zero in there,
3:18
we get false.
3:19
It doesn't tell me where it just tells me it's in there.
3:22
We can use slices,
3:24
just like we did with lists.
3:26
However, we cannot splice meaning
3:28
we can't change characters in a string.
3:31
Because strings are immutable.
3:33
So I can't have well, I guess I already have price,
3:36
I can't do something like Price Index of zero equals
3:40
and then change that to some other character.
3:43
Like hash sign,
3:45
I get an error.
3:46
String object does not support item assignment.
3:49
So I can't change characters.
3:52
Now I could concatenate strings.
3:54
So I could do
3:56
something like hash sign plus another string.
4:02
And that makes me a new string.
4:03
But both of these strings are immutable.
4:05
This third string is immutable.
4:07
I also can multiply strings,
4:09
which is kind of odd,
4:11
or might seem odd, but if I do,
4:13
how about exclamation point,
4:16
times 10.
4:18
I get 10 exclamation points.
4:20
It repeats it.
4:22
So let's practice with some slices on a string.
4:25
Here I've got a somewhat large jibberish string,
4:29
I can take a slice.
4:30
Well, first of all,
4:31
we can just access individual indices.
4:33
Nice and easy.
4:34
Just like with a list,
4:35
just like in JavaScript,
4:36
I can access the length, the length of a string.
4:40
So MSG here,
4:42
14 characters,
4:44
there is no message of 14
4:47
because the length is always one more
4:48
than the greatest index.
4:50
So the last characters index 13.
4:53
Now if I wanted to get everything from the, I don't know,
4:56
the fifth index onwards,
4:58
I could do that. Right there.
4:59
And that gives me the fifth index
5:01
to the end of the string
5:03
zero, one, two, three, four, five.
5:05
It includes that index of five.
5:07
If I did something like this, zero with index, Intel,
5:11
the fifth index,
5:12
it does not include that fifth index,
5:15
it goes up until that index.
5:16
So we end up with index zero, one, two, three, four.
5:21
And it stops there.
5:22
It does not include the I from index five.
5:25
And just like with lists,
5:27
we can also pass in an interval or a step.
5:31
So if I did something like this,
5:32
it's a secret message,
5:34
we get Hello, which was hidden in there.
5:36
So I'm going every other characters starting
5:38
from the beginning.
5:39
So H, and then we skip to E,
5:42
skip to LLO,
5:44
exclamation point, exclamation point.
5:46
And what about if we start at index of one
5:49
and do the same thing?
5:50
Oh, even better hidden message.
5:52
Chicken. Who doesn't love chickens,
5:55
not for eating, only for pets.
5:58
So slices work pretty much,
6:00
well, they actually work exactly the same way
6:02
as they do with lists.
6:03
We cannot splice a string like we could with a list,
6:06
I can't do something like index
6:08
of five onwards equals something.
6:12
Because we can assign anything
6:14
to any index in a string.
6:16
They are immutable as we saw before.
6:18
If I tried to do anything at all,
6:21
where I'm accessing an index,
6:22
and then I'm assigning it to some other thing,
6:25
we get that same error.
6:26
And then lastly,
6:27
we saw that we could iterate letter by letter over a string.
6:31
So with a for loop,
6:33
just like we could with a list
6:34
we could do for character in message.
6:38
We'll just print message,
6:40
no will print character.
6:44
And that's it.
6:44
And there we go.
6:46
Each character has been printed out.
6:49
Okay, so that's a quick recap of strings,
6:51
single quotes, double quotes, triple quotes,
6:53
which is actually okay, I guess six double quotes,
6:56
because we have three double quotes.
6:59
Three different ways.
7:00
We've got F strings,
7:02
we're able to use slices,
7:03
but not splices.
7:05
And that's about it.
7:07
We can iterate, next we're going to talk about
7:09
a bunch of built in string methods.
