can you please provide code for demonstrations of this
that would be helpful in preparing for 
my career as a deep learning AI SWE?



Would you please evaluate the transcript I provide for its key terms, ideas, 
concepts and their defintions. Would you also please include the video title 
“list splicing”, the subsection title "Python Data Structures", 
and the section title "Python Introduction"?

- [Instructor] Okay so that was slicing with an L.
0:07
Now we have splicing with a PL
0:11
splicing uses the exact same syntax,
0:13
where we have a start a stop and a interval, or a step,
0:18
separated by colons.
0:20
But rather than retrieving information,
0:22
retrieving a slice of an array or a portion
0:25
we can actually update
0:27
by adding or removing elements using that same syntax.
0:31
So I think it's easiest to show you a simple example.
0:34
Let's start with an array of colors.
0:36
Very simple one, we'll just have three colors,
0:38
red, orange, and yellow,
0:42
no splicing involved.
0:44
Now, if I wanted to instead change red to be dark red,
0:48
and light red, I wanted two elements here before orange.
0:52
What I can do is use the exact same syntax.
0:55
So I wanna start at index of zero and stop at index of one,
0:59
but I'm going to set it to a new list ,
1:03
that will include dark red.
1:06
And I guess pink is fine just like that.
1:09
And if we look at colors,
1:11
I've now replaced whatever was at index of zero Intel,
1:15
and index of one with two new elements.
1:18
So we have dark red, pink, orange yellow.
1:21
I could do the same thing.
1:23
Let's say I wanna replace the end of the list onwards.
1:27
I could do this colors,
1:30
and then index of zero one, two three to the end,
1:34
is now equal to let's go with dark yellow,
1:40
and then green, blue, and finally purple, like that.
1:50
So that same syntax, my starting point.
1:52
And then a colon means go until the end,
1:55
just like it did with slicing.
1:57
Now, if we look at colors, we have dark red, pink orange,
2:01
and then where we used to have yellow at the end.
2:03
We've now replaced that with a whole bunch of new elements.
2:07
And I could also go the other direction.
2:09
I could remove elements.
2:11
So if I wanted to get rid of, let's say blue and purple,
2:16
I need to find that index.
2:17
So zero one, two, three, four, five colors
2:21
of five to the end,
2:24
equals an empty list.
2:26
And now I've just removed two elements, blue and purple.
2:31
It's pretty uncommon, but you can use the step
2:34
or interval, the third piece of a slice.
2:38
It's just not very common.
2:39
And I'll show you why.
2:41
If I did something like this colors,
2:43
from the beginning to the end every other element.
2:48
I wanna make every other element LOL like this.
2:51
I still have to specify how many LOL I need.
2:54
So I have to calculate it.
2:56
If I just put one LOL in there, it's going to yell at me.
2:58
It says, you attempted to assign a sequence of size one,
3:02
to an extended slice of size three.
3:04
It's expecting three elements in this list because I said,
3:08
go from the beginning to the end,
3:10
by an interval or a step of two.
3:13
So there would be three things were inserting,
3:16
one and then two and then three.
3:19
So I need to add in three LOLs.
3:24
And now if we look at colors
3:26
I've inserted, LOL pink, LOL dark yellow LOL.
3:32
So I'm not just inserting it.
3:34
I'm also overriding what was there before.
3:36
It's not very common to do this
3:37
but you can see the exact same syntax.
3:41
And what's nice is that we can also insert
3:43
a bunch of stuff at the beginning.
3:44
As we saw where we add a dark red and pink, instead of red
3:48
we can add a bunch of things at the end,
3:50
or in the middle of a list,
3:52
and we can do the same thing to remove elements.
3:54
So if I wanna remove, let's say LOL and pink
3:58
I would write colors going from zero,
4:01
intel index of zero, one, two,
4:04
because it doesn't include index of two equals,
4:07
an empty list.
4:10
And now colors starts right here
4:12
and we've removed two elements.
4:15
I could also just empty out the entire thing if I wanted to,
4:18
I guess the easiest way would just be to do that.
4:21
But I could also do something like colors,
4:24
go from the beginning to the end.
4:27
And now if we look at colors, it's empty.
4:30
Okay, so the same syntax,
4:32
the same start colon stop colon step.
4:37
But instead of just retrieving a slice
4:40
we are actually updating a portion of the list
4:43
by specifying new elements to be added or an empty list,
4:47
which will remove elements from that slice.
