Sure, here's an example of using the `set` data structure in Python to determine the speed difference between searching for an item in a list versus a set:

```
import random
import time

# Generate a list of random integers
my_list = random.sample(range(1000000), 10000)

# Convert the list to a set
my_set = set(my_list)

# Search for a random integer in the list
start_time = time.time()
if 999999 in my_list:
    print("Item found in list")
else:
    print("Item not found in list")
end_time = time.time()
print("Search time for list:", end_time - start_time)

# Search for a random integer in the set
start_time = time.time()
if 999999 in my_set:
    print("Item found in set")
else:
    print("Item not found in set")
end_time = time.time()
print("Search time for set:", end_time - start_time)
```

In this example, we generate a list of 10,000 random integers and convert it to a set. We then search for a random integer in both the list and the set, and measure the time it takes to perform each search. 

Because sets use hash tables to store their elements, searching for an item in a set is generally much faster than searching for an item in a list, especially for large collections of data. 

By using appropriate data structures, you can significantly improve the speed and efficiency of your code, which is important for building high-performance deep learning models.
