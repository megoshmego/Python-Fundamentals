Subsection Title: "Python Data Structures"
Section Title: "Python Introduction"

Key Terms:
- Comprehensions: A concise way to create a new sequence from an existing one in Python.
- Dictionary: A collection of key-value pairs in Python.
- Dictionary comprehension: A concise way to create a new dictionary from an existing sequence in Python.
- Set: A collection of unique elements in Python.
- Set comprehension: A concise way to create a new set from an existing sequence in Python.
- Iterable: An object capable of returning its elements one at a time.
- Key-value pair: A pair of values used to represent a mapping between a key and a value in a dictionary.
- List: An ordered collection of elements in Python.
- List comprehension: A concise way to create a new list from an existing sequence in Python.
- String: A sequence of characters in Python.
- Tuple: An ordered, immutable collection of elements in Python.

Key Concepts:
- Comprehensions are a concise way to create new sequences in Python.
- Dictionary comprehensions use curly braces and key-value pairs to create a new dictionary from an existing sequence.
- Set comprehensions use curly braces and a single element to create a new set from an existing sequence.
- Lists, strings, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all data structures in Python.
- Lists, strings, and tuples are sequences of elements, while dictionaries and sets are collections of elements.
- Lists and dictionaries are mutable, while strings, tuples, and sets are immutable.
- List comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, and set comprehensions are commonly used in Python and are important to understand.
- To create a dictionary comprehension, you must provide both a key and a value for each item in the sequence.
- To create a set comprehension, you only need to provide a single element for each item in the sequence.
- Understanding data structures and comprehensions is important for programming in Python.


Certainly! Here's an example of using list comprehension to generate a list of even numbers:

```
# Generate a list of even numbers from 0 to 20
even_numbers = [x for x in range(21) if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)
```

Output:
```
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
```

Here's an example of using dictionary comprehension to generate a dictionary that maps numbers to their squares:

```
# Generate a dictionary that maps numbers to their squares
squares = {x: x*x for x in range(1, 11)}
print(squares)
```

Output:
```
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81, 10: 100}
```

And here's an example of using set comprehension to generate a set of unique vowels in a string:

```
# Generate a set of unique vowels in a string
s = "Hello World"
vowels = {x for x in s if x in "aeiouAEIOU"}
print(vowels)
```

Output:
```
{'e', 'o'}
```
