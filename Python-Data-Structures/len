Video Title: "len"
Section Title: "Python Introduction"
Subsection Title: "Python Data Structures"

Key Terms/Ideas/Concepts:
- Python basics: strings, ints, floats, booleans, lists, conditionals, loops, and functions
- Data Structures in Python: lists, strings, dictionaries, tuples, sets
- Built-in data structures in Python 
- The use of double underscore methods in Python
- len function in Python for finding the length of an object
- Differences between Python and JavaScript in finding the length of an object



Certainly! Here's some example code demonstrating the concepts discussed in the video:

```python
# Example of using len() with a string
string = "hello world"
string_length = len(string)
print(string_length)  # Output: 11

# Example of using len() with a list
my_list = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]
list_length = len(my_list)
print(list_length)  # Output: 4
```

In the above code, we create a string and a list, and use the `len()` function to find the length of each data structure. We then print out the length to the console. 

Note that the `len()` function can be used with other data structures as well, such as dictionaries and sets.
