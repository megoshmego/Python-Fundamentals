Key terms, ideas, and concepts mentioned in the video:

Video Title: Set Methods
Section Title: Python Introduction
Subsection Title: Python Data Structures

- Sets
- in operator
- add method
- pop method
- remove method
- len function
- copy method
- union method
- symmetric difference method
- intersection method
- difference method
- clear method
- Mutable data structures
- Immutable data structures

Concepts:

- Sets are a collection of unique elements in Python.
- The in operator checks if a value is a member of a set.
- The add method is used to add elements to a set.
- The pop method removes and returns an arbitrary set element, and it raises an error if the set is empty.
- The remove method removes a specific element from a set.
- The len function returns the length of a set.
- The copy method creates a copy of a set.
- The union method returns a new set that is a union of two or more sets.
- The symmetric difference method returns a new set that contains elements in either of the sets, but not both.
- The intersection method returns a new set that contains elements that are common to two or more sets.
- The difference method returns a new set that contains elements that are in the first set but not in the second set.
- The clear method removes all elements from a set.
- Mutable data structures, such as lists and sets, can't be stored in a set because they are not immutable.
- Immutable data structures are entirely immutable, which means that we don't have to worry about whether copy is deep or shallow.

Overall, the video provides an overview of set methods in Python and demonstrates their use through examples.

Certainly, here is an example code demonstrating some of the concepts discussed in the video:

```python
# Python Introduction - Python Data Structures - Set Methods

# Creating a set
languages = {'JavaScript', 'Ruby', 'Python'}

# Checking if an element is in the set
print('scala' in languages) # False
print('Ruby' in languages) # True

# Adding an element to the set
languages.add('scala')
print(languages) # {'JavaScript', 'Ruby', 'scala', 'Python'}

# Adding an element that is already in the set
languages.add('Python')
print(languages) # {'JavaScript', 'Ruby', 'scala', 'Python'}

# Removing an arbitrary element from the set
element = languages.pop()
print(element) # 'JavaScript'
print(languages) # {'Ruby', 'scala', 'Python'}

# Removing a specific element from the set
languages.remove('Python')
print(languages) # {'Ruby', 'scala'}

# Getting the length of the set
print(len(languages)) # 2

# Making a copy of the set
copy = languages.copy()
print(copy) # {'Ruby', 'scala'}

# Clearing the set
languages.clear()
print(languages) # set()
```

This code demonstrates the usage of the `set` data type in Python, as well as some of its methods such as `add()`, `pop()`, `remove()`, `copy()`, `clear()`, and `len()`.
